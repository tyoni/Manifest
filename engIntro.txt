				Anyhow, my name is <i>Tyoni</i>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Before all this I was an undercover agent working a case against a secret society. Sadly I had mistaken a book for a gun and well I'm here now.....
				<br>
				<br>
				Right now I'm studying Communication & Multimedia Design at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Here I learn about <i>"Human Centered Design"</i>. It's quite interesting if I'm being honest especially the part of concepting and prototyping. I really enjoy thinking up new ideas and working them out with trial and error. Kind of a metaphor for life huh...
				<br>
				<br>
				As of now I'm also looking for an internship so......
