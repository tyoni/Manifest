		Sometimes I just feel like trying something new. Learning new things is what keeps me fresh. It teaches me a new perspective. A way to unlock a little bit more of the universe. A place few have dared to venture. Sometimes I also enjoy taking naps though.

				<strong> Some more info about me</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i><u>Do you ever just see the floor as a really low shelf? 'Cause I do.</u></i>
				<br>
				<br>
				Anyhow, my name is <i>Tyoni</i>. It means cool person <strike>or atleast that's the definition I give it.</strike>
				But I am assuming you came here for a little more information about me so lets get to it:
				<br>
				<br>
				Before all this I was an undercover agent working a case against a secret society. Sadly I had mistaken a book for a gun and well I'm here now.....
				<br>
				<br>
				Kind of glad though because this is way more fun than drinking fancy champagne with some girls on a beach after a difficult task. Besides all this I also enjoy taking photo's, playing around with Premiere Pro, Afters effects and Illustrator. With my current fixation being photography but I'm starting to look more into After Effects again. Check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tyoniroosendaal/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> if you're curious <strike>or a member of the secret society I tried to dismantle</strike>
